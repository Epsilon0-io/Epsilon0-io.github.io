## What is a Limit?

When we Write
$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L
$$

it means that the values of $f(x)$ get arbitrarily close to $L$ as $x$ gets close to $a$. Esentially, you approach x from either side of the point a, and the function will get infinitely close (but never actually reaches) a value L.

## Formal Definition (ε–δ)

We say $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that

$$
0 < |x - a| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon
$$
